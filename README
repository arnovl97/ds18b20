---   DESCRIPTION   ---
-----------------------

The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to 12-bit 
Celsius  temperature  measurements  and  has  an  alarm  
function  with  nonvolatile  user-programmable  upper  and  
lower trigger points. The DS18B20 communicates over a 
1-Wire  bus  that  by  definition  requires  only  one  data  line  
(and  ground)  for  communication  with  a  central  micro-processor.
